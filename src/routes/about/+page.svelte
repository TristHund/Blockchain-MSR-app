      <p>
        Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) have a history dating back to the 1980s. 
        Introduced as a way to make home loans more affordable during times of high interest rates, ARMs have evolved over the years to include various structures and terms. 
        Initially, ARMs were simple with interest rates adjusting annually based on an index, but they have become more complex to provide better borrower protections and options.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Blockchain for Loan Transparency and Efficiency</h2>
      <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Utilizing blockchain as a system of record for ARM loans provides significant advantages:</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Every transaction and adjustment in the loan's lifecycle is recorded on an immutable ledger, accessible to all parties involved.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Streamlined operations reduce the time and cost associated with servicing and originating loans.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Blockchain ensures that data integrity is maintained, reducing the risk of fraud and errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Borrowers have greater confidence in how their loans are managed, leading to increased trust in financial institutions.</li>
